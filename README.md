This [repository](https://github.com/Kmohamedalie/Venetian-Riddle-Weaver/) hosts a fascinating riddle game designed to enhance tourism in Venice through gamification. The project leverages the concept of a "riddle-game" to engage users with the city's unique charm and history.

Key aspects of the repository include:

Purpose: To provide an interactive and engaging experience for tourists in Venice through a riddle-based game.

Technologies: The project is primarily built using JavaScript (84.0%), with supporting CSS (9.4%) for styling and HTML (6.6%) for structure.

Content: The repository contains essential game files such as game.js, index.html, and style.css, along with a README.md for project documentation and an image file venezia2.jpg, likely used within the game's interface.

Themes: The project is closely aligned with themes of tourism, hospitality, travelling, and gamification, specifically focusing on Venice.

This project appears to be a creative application of web technologies to promote tourism in an interactive way.
